MovieFlix

Watch List — A simple Rails app to create and manage movie lists (many-to-many relationship between movies and lists through bookmarks). This project was built as a Le Wagon exercise and implements models, validations, routes, controllers, views, seeds, and front-end assets (Bootstrap + Simple Form).

Movies are seeded in the database. The app does not provide creation forms for movies (they are read-only from the UI perspective).

💻 Built with
- Ruby on Rails (>= 7.x)
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap 5
- Simple Form
- RSpec (for model specs provided by Le Wagon)
